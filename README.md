# Coordinated Multi-Agent Exploration, Rendezvous, & Task Allocation in Unknown Environments with Limited Connectivity

This is a repository for the results from the paper titled "Coordinated Multi-Agent Exploration, Rendezvous, & Task Allocation in Unknown Environments with Limited Connectivity" by Lauren Bramblett, Rahul Peddi, and Nicola Bezzo

## Installation

Clone repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/laurenbramblett/Coordinated-Multi-Agent-Exploration-Rendezvous-Task-Allocation-in-Unknown-Environments.git
```

## Usage

* Running "mainFSM_run.m" will run all relevant functions given the user defined inputs
	* Make sure to change any pieces such as agent locations, maps, or tuning parameters in lines 7-67
